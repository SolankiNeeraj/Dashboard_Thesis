# Dashboard_Thesis
I prepared this dashboard for my Master's thesis work. The purpose was simple, I needed a simple dashboard to view responses from different groups for deriving conclusions from it.

How to use it:
On the top of Dashboard, multiple slicers can be seen. All the subsequent charts are linked to the slicers and line below the charts shows the summation of percent of respondents who agree to the statement.
Use the slicer to filter data according to different groups, look for patterns or significantly different results.


How to navigate the Workbbok:
Sheet "Dashboard" consists of slicers and charts to be used for finding relevant data.
Sheet "Thesis charts" was used as rough sheet for saving the charts to be added in thesis work.
Sheet "Chi square" consists of calculations to determine dependency of the variables.
Sheet "Findings" consists of significant results derived by slicing the data.
Sheet "Analysis" consists of Pivot tables used for creating charts.
Sheet "Clean Data" as name says is the data after data cleaning.
Sheet "Duplicates", as part of data cleaning, shows the similar reponses which are clubbed together.
Sheet "Comments" consists of answers received for the open text field question.
Sheet "Data" consists of the raw data received from the survey.
